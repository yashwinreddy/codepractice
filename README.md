# DevMetrics

## Disclaimer

This project is meant to be a light-hearted take on “developer analytics” and should **not** be considered an accurate representation of a developer’s skill or productivity.  

Metrics can be misleading — especially if the person just bulk-uploaded an entire VS Code workspace to GitHub in one glorious commit.  

Treat it as a fun experiment, not a hiring decision tool.
